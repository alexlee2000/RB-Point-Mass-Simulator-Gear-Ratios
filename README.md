# RB-Point-Mass-Simulator-Gear-Ratios

### Updates

Gear_Ratios_V2.ipynb
- Initial code 

Gear_Ratios_V3.ipynb
- Added in different race tracks (Endurance, Acceleration, Skidpad) 
- However, they all produce same results. Raised this issue with DAQ

Gear_Ratios_V4.ipynb
- Reverted back to Version 2 code since the point mass simulator has some unfinished links (the track parameter doesn't actually change the sim)

Gear_Ratios_V5.ipynb
- Added code to automatically stop running when results are finalised. Reduces the need to run 2 separate blocks of code
